### London Air Polution

This project involves the analysis and visualization of air quality data in London over multiple years (2013, 2016, and 2019). The goal was to observe the changes in pollution levels across different boroughs. The data was taken from the GLA and TFL Air Quality

Data Collection and Preparation:
-Collected air quality data and Lonon borough shapefiles from the GLA and TFL Air Quality for the years 2013, 2016, and 2019.
-Used the libraries 'geopandas' and 'shapely' to modify data

### Stock Trading Strategy Backtesting

Stock Trading Strategy Backtesting is a personal project where I developed and tested various stock trading strategies using historical stock data. The goal was to evaluate the performance of different strategies and visualize the results for analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>
  <p>In this project, I retrieved and stored stock data using yfinance in a SQL database to maintain a robust and scalable data storage solution. The trading strategies implemented include the Moving Average and Triple Exponential Moving Average to generate buy/sell signals in trading.</p>
  <p>The project involved the following key steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Retrieval and Storage: I fetched historical stock data from various sources and stored it in a SQL database, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval for backtesting.</li>
    <li>Strategy Implementation: I implemented the Moving Average and Triple Exponential Moving Average strategies to generate buy and sell signals based on the historical data.</li>
    <li>Backtesting: Conducted thorough backtesting of the implemented strategies using historical data. This helped in evaluating the performance of each strategy and understanding its strengths and weaknesses.</li>
    <li>Visualization: Integrated visualization tools to plot stock prices, moving averages, and trading signals. This provided a clear visual representation of the strategies and their performance over time, aiding in qualitative analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The results of the backtesting and visualizations provided insights into the effectiveness of the strategies, helping to refine and improve them further.</p>

### Stock Diversification Tool

The Stock Diversification Tool is a personal project aimed at  identifying relationships among stocks listed on Nasdaq. Using a dataset of monthly log returns, I constructed a minimum spanning tree (MST) that connects each stock based on their correlation and developed a Python tool to provide stock recommendations based on their location in the MST.

<details>
  <summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>
  <p>In this project, I compiled a comprehensive dataset of monthly log returns for all stocks on Nasdaq over a three-year period. This dataset served as the foundation for analyzing stock relationships and making informed diversification recommendations.</p>
  <p>The project involved the following key steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Compilation:</strong> Collected and compiled a dataset of monthly log returns for Nasdaq-listed stocks over a three-year period using yfinance. This involved cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree Construction:</strong> Utilized the dataset to construct a minimum spanning tree (MST). The MST helped in identifying and visualizing the relationships and correlations among different stocks.</li>
    <li><strong>Python Tool Development:</strong> Developed Python code to interact with the MST. The tool provides stock recommendations by analyzing the distance and position of stocks within the MST.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The resulting tool offers insights on stock relations.</p>

### Reddit Investment Discussion Analysis

The Reddit Investment Discussion Analysis is a personal project designed to analyze discussions on investment-related subreddits. By extracting and analyzing data from Reddit, this project aims to identify the popularity and sentiment of various stocks being discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Detailed Explanation</summary>
  <p>In this project, I developed a Python script to interface with the Reddit API and extract data from investment-related subreddits. The extracted data includes post titles, post bodies, and comments. The project involved several key steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Developed a Python script to connect to the Reddit API and gather data from specific subreddits focused on investments. This included extracting post titles, post bodies, and comments to create a comprehensive dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Mention Analysis:</strong> Processed the extracted text to identify mentions of stocks. By counting and analyzing these mentions, the project aimed to determine the popularity and frequency of different stocks being discussed on Reddit.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the extracted text. This helped in discerning the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each stock mentioned in the discussions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The resulting analysis provides insights into which stocks are most frequently discussed and how they are perceived by the Reddit investment community.</p>
